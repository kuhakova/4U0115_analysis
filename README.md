# 4U0115_analysis

This repository holds code and some data used for a part of timing and spectral analysis of 4U 0115+63. The whole work is done by using several HEASoft tools (nupipeline, nuproducts, xspec), so this Python skript explains only some part of the reseacrh process. It is also worth mentioning that the work is still in progress. The final update as well as the paper on this topic is expected to be published in 2025.

I would be glad to answer any questions about the following code, you can e-mail me at kuhakova@gmail.com.
