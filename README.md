# 4U0115_analysis

This repository holds code and some data used for a part of timing and spectral analysis of 4U 0115+63. The whole work is done by using several HEASoft tools (nupipeline, nuproducts, xspec), so this Python skript explains only some part of the reseacrh process.

I would be glad to answer any questions about this project. You can e-mail me at kuhakova@gmail.com or find me on Telegram by username @hi_i_am_katya.
